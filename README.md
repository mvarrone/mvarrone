### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
-->

# Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Matias Varrone, a Telecommunications Engineer graduated from [Universidad Blas Pascal (UBP)](https://www.ubp.edu.ar), Argentina.
- I began my career in Networking, where the need to automate daily processes led me to discover Python and Network Programmability. This journey expanded to REST API development and Vue.js to formalize internal projects.
- Currently, Iâ€™m transitioning into **Artificial Intelligence**, a field rich with potential and fascinating challenges.

## ðŸŽ“ AI Studies and Specializations
- ðŸŒ± [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) by Stanford University and DeepLearning.AI to build a solid AI foundation. You can follow my journey at [machine-learning-specialization](https://github.com/mvarrone/machine-learning-specialization)

### ðŸ“š Current specialization
- [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) by Stanford University and DeepLearning.AI to deepen my understanding of neural networks and advanced AI concepts. You can follow my journey at [deep-learning-specialization](https://github.com/mvarrone/deep-learning-specialization)

### ðŸ“… Upcoming Courses
#### After completing my current specialization, I plan to dive into:
  - Since **Computer Vision** is the field that interests me most, I'll be taking the [Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python and TensorFlow â€“ Complete Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA3WxTTPXqQ&t=4202s) to gain hands-on experience.

#### NVIDIA CUDA
  - On the other hand, Iâ€™m also interested in expanding my knowledge of CUDA technology to enhance AI performance. Therefore, the [CUDA Programming Course â€“ High-Performance Computing with GPUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86FAWCzIe_4&t=11761s) might be a great choice.

### Projects and Contributions
- âš¡ Take a look at my [automation projects](https://github.com/mvarrone/automation-projects).
- âš¡ Explore my [backend/fullstack projects](https://github.com/mvarrone/app-projects).
- âš¡ Check out some of my [Gists](https://gist.github.com/mvarrone) where I post quick fixes and useful snippets.
